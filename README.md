# Book Management API

This is my first FastAPI project, and it is used for managing books. 

## Features

This project provides functionality to:

- View books by title, category, or author.
- Add new books to the collection.
- Update details of existing books.
- Delete books from the collection.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: The backend framework used for building the API.
- **Python**: The programming language used for the project.

## Future Plans

As I continue to develop more complex projects, I aim to enhance my proficiency in FastAPI and expand the functionality of this project.
